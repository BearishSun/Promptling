Modified section rendering to show edit button (pencil icon) and delete button (trash icon) on hover. Delete button only appears for non-system sections. Inline editing with input field when edit button clicked.\n\n2. **index.css**: Added styles for .section-nav-item, .section-actions (hidden by default, shown on hover), .section-action-btn, and .section-delete-btn with red color on hover.\n\nFeatures:\n- Hover over section to see edit/delete buttons\n- Click edit button to rename inline\n- Press Enter to save, Escape to cancel\n- System sections (Features/Bugs) cannot be deleted\n- Deleting a section with items shows confirmation with item count"
